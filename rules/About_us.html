    <h2>Who We Are</h2> <p>
                    In today’s on-demand economy, it’s easier than ever to find what you want. Your favorite food delivered to your door; rides out to the bars, cleaning services when you need them – and it’s all just a swipe or touch away.
                  </p> <p>
                    But when it comes to dating, it’s still an app-filled jungle, but the other apps haven’t been able to deliver what single people really want: quality matches, with people they want to meet.

                  </p> <p>
                    Dating apps are filled with creeps, fake profiles, and spammers. Smartphones are filled with potential matches, but there’s no way to know which matches are really dream dates.

                  </p> <p>
                    Slay Connect gives you quality over quantity. The app is designed to filter out the bad and the ugly, leaving you with the best possible matches.

                  </p> <p><strong>When Is Slay Connect Officially Launching</strong></p> <p>
                   The formal S.C launch date is early November 2019.
SLAY CONNECT dating is a new app and, as you can imagine, it takes time to have enough users on the platform for you to have a pleasant experience. We have decided to allow users to join the app before launching date, so they can be involved in the app evolution through our feedback mechanisms. We anticipate gathering enough users during the pre-launch period so that the experience is rewarding for all users.

                  </p> <p>
                    Slay Connect could not be there without you, so if you like it, share it.

                  </p>
