    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2> <p>
                    SLAY CONNECT specifically prohibits any use of the Application or the Service, and you hereby agree not to use the Application or the Service, for any of the following:
Using the application to request money in any form. SLAY CONNECT forbid any exchange of cash in any form between two members/users. Any budget agreed between two users on the application is restricted to be spent only and only for activities related to dating (restaurant, night-out, concerts, events, gifts ...). SLAY CONNECT will not be held responsible for any money loss by their users or what members decide to do with the budget they agreed together.
Using the application as an escort or using the Service to solicit clients for an escort service. SC dating is strictly an online dating website/app, escorts are not welcome.

Using the application or service to "stalk" or otherwise harass any person.
Using the application or service to promote racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual;
Using the application or service for activities that violate any law, statute, ordinance, or regulations; and
Using the application or service to encourage, promote, facilitate, or instruct others to engage in illegal activity.

If you breach the terms of this subsection and send or post unsolicited bulk email, “spam”, or other unsolicited communications of any kind through the Service, you acknowledge that you will have caused substantial harm to SC dating, but that the amount of such harm would be extremely difficult to ascertain.

In call cases, please refer to the terms of your application platform which apply to your in-app purchases.
You agree that all payments made on the Application are final, and you will not challenge or dispute the charge with your bank. You further agree that should you have any issues relating to your payment (such as duplicate billing), you will open a support ticket through the Application to resolve the issue. Should a chargeback or dispute be initiated with your bank, you agree that you will be held responsible for any outstanding balance owed to us plus any chargeback fees charged by our bank, which may be as much as $50. You agree that you will pay any outstanding balance you have with SLAY CONNECT within 30 days from the date of notification.
